tuples are used to represent value in pair of number, string and different data types.
basically it creating one array where the type of fixed no. of element in known.
Array type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.

in practice i have created tuple with two data type number and string.
we cant store other type of data, if we try to add any boolean value
We get an error saying that adding a boolean value to a tuple of type 'number | string' is not permitted. Hence, a tuple declared as 'number | string' can store only number and string values.
