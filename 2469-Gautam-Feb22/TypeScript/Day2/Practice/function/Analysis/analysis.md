function can have function name, return type and parameters.
We can add types to each of the parameters and then to the function itself to add a return type. TypeScript can figure the return type out by looking at the return statements.

in practice i have created function add which has two parameter must be type of number
and return type of that function is string will return accept only in string type,
TypeScript now allow to return in other data type while return type of that funaction is defined.
