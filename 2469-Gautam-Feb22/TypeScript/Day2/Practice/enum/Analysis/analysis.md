practiced here, stored result in enum type as Pass or Fail
and assign this enum to any field insted of assigning data types.
In the practice, i have an enum named result. The enum has two values: Pass and Fail Here, enum values start from zero and increment by 1 for each member. It would be represented as:
Pass=0
Fail=1
Enums are always assigned numeric values when they are stored. The first value always takes the numeric value of 0, while the other values in the enum are incremented by 1.

numeric-based enums and string-based enums
