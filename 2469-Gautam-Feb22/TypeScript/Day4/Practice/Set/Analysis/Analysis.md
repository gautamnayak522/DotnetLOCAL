set is a new data structure added in ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows to store distinct data (each value occur only once).
Sets are a bit similar to maps, but it stores only keys, not the key-value pairs.

Set methods are used to add and delete value from set 
set.add(value) - add values in the set
set.has(value) - It returns true if the value is present in the set. Otherwise, it returns false.
set.delete() - It is used to remove the entries from the set.
set.size() - It is used to returns the size of the set.
set.clear() - It removes everything from the set.
