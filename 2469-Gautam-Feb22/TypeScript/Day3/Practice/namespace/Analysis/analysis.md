A namespace is a way that is used for logical grouping of functionalities. It allows us to organize our code in a much cleaner way. A namespace can include interfaces, classes, functions, and variables to support a group of related functionalities.
We can create a namespace by using the namespace keyword and all the interfaces, classes, functions, and variables can be defined in the curly braces{} by using the export keyword.
The namespace must be included in a file by using triple-slash (///) reference syntax. e.g.
///< reference path="path to namespace"/>
It is also known as an internal module.
