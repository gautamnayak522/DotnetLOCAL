Array Practice
Like variables, arrays too, should be declared before they are used. Array elements can access from index, index of array starting from 0.
array_name[index]
in practice : subject[0],subject[1],subject[2].
array is a collection of values. It is a user defined type.
in practice i created an array of subjects and specify types of array elements is string so only string type data can be stored into this array,
if you try to add other type data typescript compiler gives an error.
